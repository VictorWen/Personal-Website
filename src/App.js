      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a undergrad computer science major currently studying at the University of California - Los Angeles.
      I am deeply fascinated with computer science and software engineering because I love solving difficult challenges.
      To me, computers are all about solving problems.
      I love working with theory and princples to logically deduce key points of some data and or a design.
      I love the flames of creativity that inspire unique ideas and algorithms.
      I love meticulously assembling each gear of a practical application that 
      deploys all the theories and all the ideas from before, 
      to craft an elegant and flexible solution.
      But most of all, I love learning and experiencing new concepts, theories, algorithms, etc. each time I undergo this process.
       </p>

       <h2>Experience</h2>
       <p>Almost all of my projects come from personal projects that were designed with the intent of learning something new.
       My early expeditions into computer science involved understanding the basics of programming and object-oriented design.
       Such projects include a simple text-based graphics engine and a short video game. Both of which developed my understanding of 
       how an object-oriented design organizes different pieces of the program, and how those pieces became integrated together.
       I have experience with machine learning and data science. Projects in this area include a music-genre classification app, a March Madness prediction app,
       and a basic machine learning Java library. Recently, I have been working on various web applications. These include cookbook MERN-like website,
       this personal website, and a AI-based research paper visualization application. Finally, the biggest project I have been working on is another video game.
       But this time, it's sole purpose was to be large, so I could experience working with a large project and with various frameworks. The game uses the Unity game engine.
       I have been working on and off on this project for a year, accumulating over 7,800 lines of code. Although the project is nowhere near complete nor up to industry standard,
       I have learned a great deal about software design and engineering.</p>
